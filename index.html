            <p>
                This assignment involves creating a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Canvas API. 
                It supports basic operations (+, -, *, /, %, parentheses), expression evaluation, backspace functionality, and error handling for invalid expressions. 
                The project focuses on rendering with the Canvas API and does not use external frameworks. 
                The user interface is fully rendered on a canvas element, demonstrating advanced graphics programming techniques.
